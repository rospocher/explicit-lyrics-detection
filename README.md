# Explicit Lyrics Detection

![logo](explicit_logo.png)

This repository collects materials related to the detection of explicit song lyrics, i.e., determining if the lyrics of a given song could be offensive or unsuitable for children.

The [english](english/) folder contains Python code for detecting explicit song lyrics in English, while the [italian](italian/) folder contains Python code for detecting explicit song lyrics in Italian. Folder [english-reasons](english-reasons/) provides material for tackling the fine-grained detection of explicit content in (English) song lyrics.

Links to ready-to-use models for detecting explicit lyrics are available in both folders.
